# The Last Lighthouse Keeper

*A Gojipedia Original Short Story*

Matsuo Tanaka had manned the lighthouse on Odo Island for forty years. He had watched typhoons tear fishing boats apart against the rocks below. He had seen the sea glow green with bioluminescence so thick it looked like the water itself was on fire. He had heard the old songs the fishermen sang, the ones about Gojira, the god from the deep.

He thought he had seen everything the sea could offer.

He was wrong.

---

The night it happened, the barometer had been dropping all day. Matsuo noted it in his logbook with the same careful precision he applied to everything. 996 millibars at dawn. 987 by noon. 973 when the sun set behind clouds so thick they seemed to swallow the light whole.

The fishermen had pulled their boats onto the beach early. Old Hayashi, whose family had lived on Odo for twelve generations, stopped by the lighthouse with a bottle of sake.

"Bad night," Hayashi said. "The fish are gone. Swam for deep water three days ago."

Matsuo accepted the sake and poured two cups. "Storm coming."

"More than storm." Hayashi stared out the window at the darkening sea. "My grandfather used to say the fish know things we don't. When they run, something is coming after them."

Matsuo had heard this before. Every islander over sixty had stories. Footprints in the jungle. Boats pulled under by something bigger than any whale. The old religion that predated Buddhism and Shinto alike, the one that left offerings at the sea cave on the island's north shore.

"Superstition," Matsuo said, but he said it gently.

"Perhaps." Hayashi finished his sake and stood. "Keep the light burning tonight, old friend. If something is out there, it should know where the rocks are."

The storm hit at midnight.

Matsuo had weathered hundreds of storms from this lighthouse. He knew the rhythm of them: the initial gusts, the building intensity, the terrible calm eye, the renewed fury on the backside. This storm followed no rhythm he recognized.

The wind came from the wrong direction. It should have been from the southeast, pushing the waves against the cliffs. Instead, it blew from the ocean straight toward the island, as if something out there was displacing so much water it created its own weather system.

At 2 AM, the lighthouse beam swept across something in the water.

Matsuo blinked. Rubbed his eyes. Looked again.

The beam completed its rotation and illuminated the same spot. There was nothing there. Just waves, higher than they should be, moving toward shore with unnatural purpose.

Then the sea began to glow.

It started as a faint blue luminescence, like the bioluminescence Matsuo had seen before. But it grew brighter. And brighter. Until the entire bay was lit from below by a cold blue light that pulsed like a heartbeat.

Matsuo grabbed his binoculars with hands that had begun to shake.

The water rose.

Not like a wave. Waves move horizontally, carrying energy toward shore. This was vertical. A dome of water lifted from the bay, shedding spray in sheets, revealing something beneath.

Spines. Black as volcanic rock, arranged in three parallel rows along a back broader than any ship.

A head emerged. Matsuo's mind tried to process what he was seeing and failed. It was reptilian, but no reptile had ever been this large. The jaw alone was longer than the fishing boats pulled up on the beach below.

Eyes found the lighthouse beam. Matsuo watched them track across the water, following the light to its source. They settled on the lighthouse.

On him.

For a moment that stretched into eternity, Matsuo Tanaka met the gaze of something that should not exist. He saw intelligence there. Ancient and alien, but intelligence nonetheless. The creature was assessing him, weighing him, deciding if he was threat or prey or something not worth the effort.

The eyes turned away.

The creature, the god, the monster, moved toward shore. Each step sent tsunamis crashing against the rocks. The lighthouse shook so violently that the lens mechanism groaned and threatened to seize. Matsuo gripped the railing and watched as the thing that could only be Gojira climbed onto Odo Island.

It walked past the lighthouse without a second glance. The footsteps shook the ground like earthquakes, growing fainter as the creature moved inland. Toward the center of the island. Toward the old shrine that nobody used anymore.

Matsuo stood at the lighthouse window until dawn, watching the blue glow pulse from the island's interior.

When morning came, Matsuo descended the lighthouse stairs on legs that barely held him. He found Hayashi and the other fishermen gathered on the beach, staring at footprints in the sand. Each print was deep enough to stand in. A child could have used one as a swimming pool.

"The offerings," Hayashi said quietly. "We stopped making them. After the war, we told ourselves it was superstition. Backward thinking."

"What did you offer?" Matsuo asked.

"Fish. First catch of each season. Sometimes a goat, on bad years." Hayashi's voice cracked. "We thought we were modern. We thought the old ways didn't matter."

The ground trembled. From the center of the island came a sound like nothing Matsuo had ever heard: a roar that was also a song, a warning, a declaration. It echoed off the mountains and carried out to sea, where it would travel for miles.

Matsuo looked at his lighthouse. At the beam that had swept across the god's face. At the mechanism he had maintained for forty years.

"I need to make a phone call," he said.

Three weeks later, a ship arrived from Tokyo. Men in suits and scientists in white coats swarmed the island, taking readings, collecting samples, interviewing everyone who had seen anything.

Matsuo told them everything. The fish fleeing. The storm. The glow. The eyes that had found him in the lighthouse beam and decided he was insignificant.

A young scientist listened and took notes. "You say it looked at you?"

"It looked through me," Matsuo corrected. "I don't think it cares about us. We're too small. But it knows we're here."

"And you believe it will return?"

Matsuo thought about the old songs. About offerings made for generations before the modern world decided such things were primitive. About a creature that had walked past his lighthouse like a man walking past an anthill.

"I believe it never really left," he said. "It was always out there. Sleeping, maybe. Waiting. We just forgot to pay attention."

The scientist wrote this down with the same detachment Matsuo used when recording barometric pressure. "Thank you, Mr. Tanaka. Your testimony has been very helpful."

After the ship left, Matsuo returned to his lighthouse. He climbed the stairs, checked the mechanisms, and began his nightly watch.

The sea was calm. The barometer read 1013 millibars.

But somewhere in the deep water beyond the bay, the fish had still not returned.

Matsuo opened his logbook and wrote:

*Day 14,612. Clear skies. Normal pressure. No unusual activity. The light burns.*

*Gojira has not appeared again.*

*But the fish remember.*

*And so do I.*
