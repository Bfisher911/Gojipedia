# Understanding the Fan Power Index

Every monster on Gojipedia has a Fan Power Index (FPI) score. You will see it prominently displayed on monster profiles, used in directory sorting, and referenced throughout the site. This article explains exactly what that number means and how we calculate it.

## What the FPI Is (And Isn't)

The Fan Power Index is a fan-made metric. We created it to provide a consistent framework for comparing monsters across different eras and continuities. It is meant to spark discussion and provide context, not settle debates definitively.

The FPI is not:

- Official canon from Toho or Legendary
- A measure of which monster would "always win" in a fight
- Fixed or unchangeable

We update scores as new films provide new feats, and we welcome reasoned feedback from the community.

## The Five Components

Each monster receives a score from 0-100 in five categories:

### Durability (20% of total)

How much punishment can this kaiju absorb? We consider:

- Natural armor and hide thickness
- Regeneration speed and completeness
- Resistance to specific damage types (heat, cold, energy)
- Survival of devastating attacks in canon

Godzilla scores extremely high here. His nuclear-powered regeneration has allowed him to recover from near-death repeatedly. King Ghidorah also scores well, having regenerated from a single head.

### Attack Power (25% of total)

Raw destructive capability, including:

- Physical strength (lifting, striking, biting)
- Beam and projectile attacks
- Area-of-effect damage potential
- Demonstrated destruction in canon

King Ghidorah's triple gravity beams can level city blocks in seconds. Mechagodzilla's arsenal includes missiles, lasers, and the devastating proton scream. These monsters score highest in attack power.

### Mobility (15% of total)

Speed, agility, and repositioning ability:

- Ground movement speed
- Flight capability and speed
- Burrowing or swimming
- Dodge/evasion in combat

Rodan dominates this category with supersonic flight. Mothra and King Ghidorah also score well. Godzilla, despite his power, moves slowly on land and scores lower here.

### Intelligence (15% of total)

Problem-solving, tactical thinking, and adaptability:

- Learning during combat
- Use of environment
- Cooperation with allies
- Recognizing and exploiting weaknesses

Kong leads this category. He uses tools, sets traps, and adapts strategies mid-fight. Godzilla shows tactical intelligence when he remembers past encounters and exploits known weaknesses.

### Special Abilities (25% of total)

Unique powers beyond basic attacks:

- Versatility of abilities
- Game-changing or decisive powers
- Abilities that counter specific threats
- Unique survival mechanisms

Mothra's reincarnation cycle, Godzilla's nuclear pulse, and King Ghidorah's alien physiology all score highly. A monster with one devastating ability scores lower than one with multiple useful powers.

## The Formula

We calculate the base score as a weighted average:

```
Base = (Durability × 0.20) +
       (Attack × 0.25) +
       (Mobility × 0.15) +
       (Intelligence × 0.15) +
       (Special × 0.25)
```

## Era Scaling

Kaiju power levels have increased over time. A MonsterVerse titan is depicted as far more powerful than a Showa-era monster, even when it is the same character. We apply an Era Scaling Factor (ESF) to account for this:

- Showa Era: 0.85-0.95
- Heisei Era: 0.95-1.00
- Millennium Era: 0.95-1.05
- Reiwa Era: 1.00-1.10
- MonsterVerse: 1.05-1.15

The final FPI = Base Score × Era Scaling Factor, capped at 100.

## Example Calculation

Let's walk through Godzilla (MonsterVerse version):

| Category | Score | Weight | Contribution |
|----------|-------|--------|--------------|
| Durability | 98 | 0.20 | 19.6 |
| Attack Power | 95 | 0.25 | 23.75 |
| Mobility | 60 | 0.15 | 9.0 |
| Intelligence | 85 | 0.15 | 12.75 |
| Special | 92 | 0.25 | 23.0 |

Base Score: 88.1

Era Scaling Factor: 1.08 (MonsterVerse)

**Final FPI: 88.1 × 1.08 = 95**

## Why These Weights?

We weighted attack and special abilities highest (25% each) because kaiju films ultimately come down to combat. Durability (20%) matters because survival is essential. Mobility and intelligence (15% each) contribute but are less decisive in most confrontations.

This weighting is debatable. A mobility-focused system would rank Rodan higher. An intelligence-focused system would elevate Kong. We chose weights that matched our subjective sense of overall threat level.

## Limitations

The FPI has inherent limitations:

**Inconsistent Canon**: Godzilla's power fluctuates wildly depending on plot needs. We average across appearances.

**Matchup Dependence**: A lower-FPI monster might beat a higher one due to specific counters. Destoroyah's Oxygen Destroyer-based powers are particularly effective against Godzilla, for example.

**Subjectivity**: Despite our methodology, score assignments involve judgment calls. Two reasonable people might differ.

**Era Mixing**: Comparing a 1964 monster to a 2019 one requires assumptions about how era scaling works.

## Community Feedback

We want the FPI to be useful and reasoned. If you believe a score is significantly off, we welcome feedback:

1. Cite specific feats from films or official materials
2. Explain which component you think should change
3. Suggest a revised score with reasoning

We review all feedback and update scores when compelling cases are made.

## Conclusion

The Fan Power Index gives us a shared language for discussing kaiju capabilities. It is a starting point for conversation, not the final word. Use it to explore monster strengths and weaknesses, but remember that the magic of kaiju cinema lies in the unexpected.

Sometimes the underdog wins. That is what makes these movies fun.
